# EE298-HW1_CIFAR10
HW #1 in EE 298 Z - Deep Learning

Build a classifier on CIFAR10 dataset using
<br>1. 3-layer MLP
<br>2. 3-layer CNN
<br>3. The last layer is Dense
<br>4. Up to you to determine the hyperparameters (ie kernel size, # hidden units, # of filters, learning rate, optimizer, etc)
<br>5. Show your solution using Jupyter notebook
<br>6. Implement using Keras or Pytorch
<br>7. Compare performance of both networks (best MLP vs best CNN)


<br> # The 3 Layer MLP attains a Maximum Testing Accuracy of 61.57%  and Testing Accuracy of 57.32%

<br> # The 3 Layer CNN attains a Maximum Testing Accuracy of 89.44%  and Testing Accuracy of 87.45%
